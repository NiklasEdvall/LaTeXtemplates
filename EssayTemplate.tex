\begin{center}
\LARGE{The title of this document goes here}
\end{center}

\vspace{5mm} % Distance, title to first section

\section*{The first section} %Star (*) blocks section title from being numbered.
The first section can contain some text. If one sentence is not enough, it can always be followed up by a second one.\\

\section*{Then the second}
To follow up on the very short first section, some value may exist in providing a second section. Especially in a template document like this one, repetition can be what really makes the point. \\

The second section may even contain a second paragraph, mainly to remind the writer on the use of $\backslash\backslash$. However, a more common way to escape special characters (i.e. \$ or \#) is to use a single $\backslash$. \\

\section*{Final section}
Finally then, we get to the point where we can put in a small code example, as below. And really, this template should be updated asap to also include a figure or two. Anyway, here is some intended text in a code-looking font:\\

{\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont
sub-123/ \\
\tab ses-210303/ \\
\tab \tab meg/ \\
\tab \tab \verb|sub-123_ses-210303_task-sensmot_run-1_meg.fif| \\
\tab \tab \verb|sub-123_ses-210303_task-sensmot_run-1_meg.json| 
}\\

To wrap up then, what about citations and a bibliography? Speaking about figures, as mentioned above, maybe the template figure could be a Bland-Altman plot, first described now almost 30 years ago (\cite{altman_measurement_1983}).

\break %New page

\printbibliography %insert bibliography

\end{document}
